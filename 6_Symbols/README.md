```bash
chmod +x ./create_real_files.sh && ./create_real_files.sh || true; chmod +x ./create_journey_files.sh && ./create_journey_files.sh || true; chmod +x ./create_folders.sh && ./create_folders.sh || true; chmod +x ./create_environment_files.sh && ./create_environment_files.sh || true ; chmod +x ./create_main_readme.sh && ./create_main_readme.sh || true
```


To execute your sequence of scripts in a single line while ensuring that errors in individual commands don't halt the overall execution, you can chain them using the `|| true` construct. This approach allows each script to run independently, ignoring any errors that may occur. Here's how you can structure the one-liner:



In this command:

- Each `chmod +x` ensures that the subsequent script is executable.
- The `&&` operator ensures that the script runs only if the `chmod` command succeeds.
- The `|| true` construct after each script execution suppresses any errors from that script, allowing the chain to continue regardless of individual failures. citeturn0search8

This method ensures that all your scripts are executed in sequence, and any errors encountered in a particular script won't interrupt the execution of the subsequent scripts.
